## 🎯 Project Overview

This project analyzes the **free-to-paid conversion rate** of students on the 365 Data Science platform. The goal is to understand user behavior from registration through engagement to subscription purchase, providing actionable business insights. 

**Key Objective:** Determine what fraction of students who watch a free lecture eventually purchase a subscription, and analyze the time patterns in their journey.

## ❓ Business Questions

This analysis answers the following critical business questions:

| # | Question |
|---|----------|
| 1 | What is the **free-to-paid conversion rate** of students who have watched a lecture on the 365 platform? |
| 2 | What is the **average duration** between the registration date and when a student watches a lecture for the first time? |
| 3 | What is the **average duration** between the date of first-time engagement and when a student purchases a subscription?  |
| 4 | How can we **interpret these results**, and what are their implications for the business? |

## 🗄️ Dataset Description

### Database:  `db_course_conversions`

The analysis uses three interconnected tables:

| Table | Description | Key Fields |
|-------|-------------|------------|
| `student_info` | Contains student registration information | `student_id`, `date_registered` |
| `student_engagement` | Records of lecture viewing activity | `student_id`, `date_watched` |
| `student_purchases` | Purchase transaction records | `student_id`, `date_purchased` |

### Data Relationships

The Venn diagram above illustrates how the three tables relate:

- **student_info** (outer circle): Contains ALL registered students
- **student_engagement** (yellow/shaded): Students who watched at least one lecture - this is a SUBSET of student_info
- **student_purchases** (overlapping circle): Students who made a purchase - partially overlaps with engagement

**Key Insight:** Not all students who register will watch lectures, and not all who watch will purchase.  Our analysis focuses on the yellow shaded region - students who have engaged with content.

## 🔬 Methodology

### Approach Overview

```
┌─────────────────┐     ┌─────────────────┐     ┌─────────────────┐
│   TASK 1        │     │   TASK 2        │     │   TASK 3        │
│   Create        │ ──► │   Calculate     │ ──► │   Interpret     │
│   Subquery      │     │   Metrics       │     │   Results       │
└─────────────────┘     └─────────────────┘     └─────────────────┘
```

### Task 1: Create the Subquery (Data Preparation)

**Objective:** Create a result dataset by joining the three tables with the following columns: 

| Column | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `student_id` | INT | Unique identification of a student |
| `date_registered` | DATE | Date when student registered on the platform |
| `first_date_watched` | DATE | Date of first engagement (first lecture watched) |
| `first_date_purchased` | DATE | Date of first purchase (NULL if no purchase) |
| `days_diff_reg_watch` | INT | Days between registration and first watch |
| `days_diff_watch_purch` | INT | Days between first watch and first purchase |

**Filter Criteria:**
- Include students where `first_date_watched <= first_date_purchased`
- Include students who watched but never purchased (NULL purchases)

**Sanity Check:** Result should contain **20,255 records**

### Task 2: Create the Main Query (Metric Calculation)

**Objective:** Calculate three key business metrics using the subquery: 

| Metric | Formula | Description |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| `conversion_rate` | (Students who purchased / Students who watched) × 100 | Percentage of engaged students who convert to paid |
| `av_reg_watch` | SUM(days_diff_reg_watch) / COUNT(days_diff_reg_watch) | Average days from registration to first lecture |
| `av_watch_purch` | SUM(days_diff_watch_purch) / COUNT(days_diff_watch_purch) | Average days from first lecture to purchase |

### Task 3: Interpretation

**Objective:** Analyze the results considering: 
- Distribution symmetry (mean vs median vs mode)
- Outliers and their impact
- Common patterns in user behavior
- Business implications

## 💻 SQL Solution Approach

### Task 1: Creating the Subquery

**Step 1: Join the Tables**

```sql
FROM
    student_engagement e
        JOIN
    student_info i ON e.student_id = i.student_id
        LEFT JOIN
    student_purchases p ON e.student_id = p. student_id
```

**Why these JOINs? **
- `INNER JOIN` with `student_info`: All engaged students are registered (engagement is subset of info)
- `LEFT JOIN` with `student_purchases`: Not all engaged students purchase, so we keep NULL values for non-purchasers

**Step 2: Select Required Columns with Aggregations**

```sql
SELECT 
    e.student_id,
    i.date_registered,
    MIN(e.date_watched) AS first_date_watched,
    MIN(p.date_purchased) AS first_date_purchased,
    DATEDIFF(MIN(e.date_watched), i.date_registered) AS days_diff_reg_watch,
    DATEDIFF(MIN(p.date_purchased), MIN(e.date_watched)) AS days_diff_watch_purch
```

**Why MIN()?**
- A student may watch multiple lectures - we need the **FIRST** date
- A student may make multiple purchases - we need the **FIRST** purchase date

**Why DATEDIFF()?**
- Calculates the difference in days between two dates
- Syntax: `DATEDIFF(later_date, earlier_date)`
- Returns NULL if either date is NULL

**Step 3: Group and Filter**

```sql
GROUP BY e.student_id
HAVING first_date_purchased IS NULL
    OR first_date_watched <= first_date_purchased;
```

**Why HAVING instead of WHERE?**
- We're filtering on aggregated columns (`first_date_watched`, `first_date_purchased`)
- `WHERE` filters before aggregation, `HAVING` filters after

**Why this filter condition?**
- `first_date_purchased IS NULL`: Include students who never purchased
- `first_date_watched <= first_date_purchased`: Only include logical conversions (watched before purchasing)
- Uses `OR` because these conditions are mutually exclusive

### Task 1 Output (20,255 records):

  <img src="images/subquery_results.png" alt="Subquery Results - 20,255 rows" width="800">
</p>

### Task 2: Creating the Main Query

**Wrapping the Subquery:**

```sql
SELECT 
    ROUND(COUNT(first_date_purchased) / COUNT(first_date_watched), 2) * 100 AS conversion_rate,
    ROUND(SUM(days_diff_reg_watch) / COUNT(days_diff_reg_watch), 2) AS av_reg_watch,
    ROUND(SUM(days_diff_watch_purch) / COUNT(days_diff_watch_purch), 2) AS av_watch_purch
FROM
    (SUBQUERY) a;
```

**Why COUNT() works for conversion_rate:**
- `COUNT(first_date_purchased)`: Counts only non-NULL values (students who purchased)
- `COUNT(first_date_watched)`: Counts all engaged students
- Division gives the conversion ratio

## 💡 Key Insights & Interpretation

### 1. Conversion Rate Analysis (11%)

**Observation:** The conversion rate of approximately 11% means that for every 100 students who come to the platform and watch a lecture, roughly 11 of them purchase a subscription.

**Context:**
- At first glance, this may seem relatively low
- However, this is reasonable for a freemium education platform because:
  - Many students register out of **curiosity**
  - The platform targets a **beginner audience** who may be exploring options
  - Some users prefer to take their first steps in data science **elsewhere**
  - Educational purchase decisions require **consideration time**

**Business Implication:** Focus on converting the engaged users rather than just increasing registrations.

### 2. Registration to First Watch (3.42 days average)

**Key Finding:** The **mean is 3.42 days**, but both **median and mode are 0 days**. 

**What this tells us:**
- **Mode = 0**:  The most common behavior is watching a lecture on the **same day** as registration
- **Median = 0**: At least half of all students watch on registration day
- **Mean = 3.42**: Higher due to **outliers** - some students wait much longer

**Distribution:** This indicates a **right-skewed distribution**:
```
Most students ──────► Immediate engagement (Day 0)
Some students ──────► Delayed engagement (outliers pulling mean up)
```

**Business Implication:**
- The platform's onboarding is effective - most users engage immediately
- Consider reaching out to users who haven't engaged within the first week
- Investigate why some users delay (confusion about where to start?)

### 3. First Watch to Purchase (26.25 days average)

**Observation:** Students take nearly a month on average from their first lecture to making a purchase decision.

**Possible Interpretations:**
- **Shorter span** would suggest compelling content or effective up-sell strategies
- **Longer span** might indicate students are: 
  - Waiting for promotional offers/discounts
  - Evaluating the platform thoroughly
  - Completing free content before committing
  - Facing financial decision-making time

**Business Implication:** Consider targeted offers around the 3-4 week mark after first engagement.

### 4. Distribution Insights

**Right-Skewed Data:**
- When mean > median, outliers exist on the higher end
- Some students take exceptionally long to decide
- The "typical" student behavior is better represented by median/mode

**Common Patterns:**
- A mode of 0 for registration-to-watch suggests the registration process and initial platform experience are user-friendly
- Most students begin watching on their registration day or the day after
